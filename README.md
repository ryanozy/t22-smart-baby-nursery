# T22 Smart Baby Nursery Project
This project will be a proof-of-concept for our IoT module, where we will be designing a smart baby nursery. Leveraging on **Smart Home** technology to build an all-in-one **Smart Baby Nursery**

## Project Equipment
1. Raspberry Pi4
2. Raspberry Pi Pico W
3. M5 StickC-Plus
4. Temperature + Humidity Sensor (MQTT Topic: `temperature-humidity`)
5. Servos Motor
6. Motor
7. Raspberry Pi-Cam
8. LED-Lights
9. Sound Sensor
10. Raspberry Pi3

## Software/Protocols/Technology Used
1. Python
2. Home Assistant
3. MQTT
4. Scapy (UDP)
5. Arduino

## Project Logs
1. We will abandon the usage of the Pico W, as we had some issues setting up the MQTT protocol on the Pico W. We will be using the M5 StickC-Plus instead.
2. Currently unable to connect the Pi-Cam to the Raspberry Pi4, as the Pi-Cam is not compatible with the Raspberry Pi4. We will be using a Pi3 instead.

## Project Setup
(In construction...)
